Users stream video or OTT content on internet-enabled devices via content delivery networks (CDNs). When a user reaches an ad break, the SSAI server requests ads from third-party ad servers. The SSAI server then stitches those ads – at the same bitrate, frame rate and audio level as the underlying stream – directly into the content, which is passed back to the viewing device via the CDN.
